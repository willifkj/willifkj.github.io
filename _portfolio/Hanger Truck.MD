## Introduction to Top-down modeling

Top-down 3D modeling is a technique that utilizes the known 3D structure of objects in a scene to estimate depth and structure for new and related 3D components streamlining the design process without the need for constantly measuring physical objects. In addition, the entire assembly lives in one document allowing for easy joint structuring for a complete assembly. When designing the mount, one used the handlebars and a phone model as structures to build from, eliminating measurements for all relative constraints without looking at external data.


### Application: Design Constraints

In the quest to create a versatile bike phone holder that enhances the cycling experience, the focus remains on effortless attachment and optimal functionality. Engineered to securely grip 23-25 mm handlebars without causing any damage, the holder eliminates the hassle of drilling or using set screws during installation. Additionally, attaching the phone is seamless, enabling uninterrupted access to all its features. With the ability to adjust between vertical and horizontal orientations during the ride, the holder offers both convenience and adaptability. Whether one prefers landscape or portrait mode, the holder ensures an enjoyable and distraction-free biking experience.

To securely attach the holder to handlebars of various diameters, a versatile screw and nut system was employed. Similarly, a screw and cap mechanism are utilized to secure a ball joint connected to the phone holder, enabling users to freely adjust and rotate their device for optimal viewing angles.

Constructed entirely from PLA, a prevalent 3D printing material, the mount provides both rigidity to support the phone and threading for the ball joint connection. Additionally, the thin PLA construction offers flexibility, facilitating easy insertion and removal of the phone. This combination of rigidity and flexibility ensures stability while accommodating seamless phone adjustments, enhancing user convenience and overall functionality.

### Assembly Instructions

1. Begin by attaching the ball joint to the base mount using the provided cap. Ensure a secure connection to enable smooth movement.

2. Connect the ball joint stem to the designated slot on the phone holder. This step ensures that your device will be properly secured and easily adjustable.

3. Position the mount over the handlebar of your bike. Align it according to your preferred angle for optimal viewing.

4. Gradually tighten the mount bolt until it forms a snug fit around the handlebar. Be cautious not to over-tighten, as this may cause damage.

5. Once the mount is securely in place, test the stability by gently moving the device. If necessary, make minor adjustments to ensure a secure and stable fit.

6. Your assembly is now complete! Enjoy the convenience and versatility of your newly installed bike phone holder during your rides.
