# Introduction

The purpose of the syringe pump device is to accurately control the movement of a syringe's plunger for dispensing and withdrawing liquids. Designed as a cost-effective alternative to commercial models, it utilizes a stepper motor, lead screw, and custom 3D printed parts. The device is suitable for both laboratory microfluidic applications and medical institutions for administering medicine and nutrients.

* **Accurate Liquid Control:** Precise movement of the syringe plunger for accurate dispensing and withdrawal of liquids.
