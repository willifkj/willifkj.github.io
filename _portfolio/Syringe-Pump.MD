# Features

The purpose of the syringe pump device is to accurately control the movement of a syringe's plunger for dispensing and withdrawing liquids. Designed as a cost-effective alternative to commercial models, it utilizes a stepper motor, lead screw, and custom 3D printed parts. The device is suitable for both laboratory microfluidic applications and medical institutions for administering medicine and nutrients.

* **Accurate Liquid Control:** Precise movement of the syringe plunger for accurate dispensing and withdrawal of liquids.
* **Cost-Effective DIY Design:** A cost-effective alternative to commercial syringe pumps.
* **Modular Design:** Custom 3D printed parts, including syringe supports, motor mount, and electronics enclosure for easy assembly and disassembly.
* **Compatibility:** Accommodates syringes of sizes 5 mL to 20 mL.
* **Stepper Motor Mechanism:** Driven by a stepper motor coupled to a lead screw for controlled linear actuation.
* **Limit Switch:** Incorporates a limit switch to stop motion when the plunger reaches the end.
* **Adjustable Flow Rate:** Flow rate can be easily set and adjusted using the Arduino program.
* **LED Indicator:** LED changes color (green, yellow, red) to indicate operational status (running, paused, complete).
* **Clean Electrical Wiring:** Short, clean, and properly terminated electrical wiring with protection for soldered joints.
* **LCD Display:** Displays real-time flow rate and time remaining until the syringe pump is empty.
* **Potentiometer Control:** Flow rate can be controlled using a supplied potentiometer.
* **Protective Enclosure:** Electrical components and connections are protected from liquid exposure within the enclosure.
* **Unique Branding:** Incorporates unique branding, aligning with the team's name (Dimensional Divas).
* **Quiet Operation:** Acknowledges the noise limitation in healthcare settings.
* **Ease of Use:** Simple operation with an ON/OFF button and potentiometer for user-friendly experience.
